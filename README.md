# natcap-invest-docker

This repo is a docker wrapper around https://bitbucket.org/natcap/invest.

Currently the focus is on running the pollination model but it could easily be adapted to run any of the other models.

See the README.md in each version directory for how to run them. The versions mirror the versions of InVEST itself.
